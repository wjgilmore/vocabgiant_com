# VocabGiant

This repository maintains the companion project to the forthcoming book, "Easy React: Build Powerful Web Apps Using Modern JavaScript Technologies" ([http://easyreactbook.com](http://easyreactbook.com)).

Being a Git repository, you'll need to possess at least rudimentary Git skills to make the most of these examples. If you're not familiar with Git I suggest having a look Scott Chacon's great book (available for free online), "[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book)", in addition to Neo's fantastic online "[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)" course.

Learn more about the book at [http://easyreactbook.com](http://easyreactbook.com). You can download the introduction and first chapter for free!

## Installing VocabGiant

VocabGiant takes advantage of many different technologies, including [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Reflux](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs), MongoDB, Mongoose, Superagent, Gulp, and others. It is intended to provide relative newcomers to React and modern JavaScript alike with a sane example of how all of these fascinating technologies work together to create a working application.

## Demo

A (slow) Heroku-hosted demo is currently available at [http://blooming-temple-4225.herokuapp.com/](http://blooming-temple-4225.herokuapp.com/). Over the next few days I'll migrate it to the VocabGiant.com URL and ensure it has proper resources to run responsively.
